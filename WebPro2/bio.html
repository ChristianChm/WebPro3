			Web Designer Christian Chmielewski

		<h2>Who Is He?</h2>
        <p>Christian Chmielewski is a web designer from Jacksonville, Fl who is
            studying at FSCJ South Campus for Computer Programming, currently 
            working towards his Java Programming Certificate. Fluent with modern
            web applications like Microsoft Office, he's able to gather and display
            data efficiently and effectively throughout his projects. Particularly
            useful when considering his understanding of project management, which
            requires good planning and execution. Christian started his programming 
            journey learning the basics in pseudocode with his peers, and plans
            to continue his education, web development, and programming skills in
            in the future.</p>
        <h2>Where Is He Now?</h2>
        <p>Christian is still studying at FSCJ's South Campus and has no intentions
            to stop anytime soon. Currently, he is building an understanding for
            HTML5 and CSS alongside his Java course. This website actually happens
            to be a project of his to demonstrate what his first month in the class
            has taught him. He is also taking an Information Systems course this
            semester (Spring 2022) which will help him better understand the software, 
            hardware, and service people use to manage information.
        </p>
        <h3>Where Is He Going?</h3>
        <p>Although Christian still has one semester left before he completes his
            first technical certificate, he has plans lined up to put all of his
            new found knowledge to use, and is ready for even more. During Summer
            of 2022, he plans to take courses in SQL database development and
            admistration, advanced Java programming, and developing enterprise
            applications using Java EE. After completion, he plans to pursue a 
            career in programming, web development, or both, and continue his
            education in other programming languages such as Python, C, and C++.
            His vision is to write new programs that will one day change the world.
