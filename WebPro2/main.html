        <p>Thank you for visiting my second website project for the 2022 Web
            Technologies Spring Semester. This site will demonstrate what I've
            learned so far in terms of responiveness, connectivity, creativity,
            structure, design, and other abilities. Please feel free to look
            around the site and explore what I have to demonstrate. The
            following paragraphs will discuss what you find in the various 
            pages of this website.
        </p>
            <h1>Content</h1>
                <p>Here I will displaying some of the
                    assignments I've worked on this semester. There will also be
                    additional links to other part of the website here as some parts
                    were prior projects, making them "content". This page specifically
                    has some responsive aspects to it, so if you're able, pull it up
                    on another device and see what changes. The project showcase page
                    especially gave me trouble, so please spend some time there and let
                    me know what you think through the various links to contact me. </p>
            <h2>Employment Application</h2>
                <p>This is a great place to go for an application. Below, you
                    can find both my job application for anyone looking to hire a new guy
                    for an IT position. You can also find a form that you can fill out and 
                    print if you're looking to get hired in the IT field as well. If you
                    are concerned about your privacy while doing so, view our privacy
