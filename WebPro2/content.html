        <p>Welcome to my content page! Here I will displaying some of the
            assignments I've worked on this semester. There will also be
            additional links to other part of the website here as some parts
            were prior projects, making them "content". This page specifically
            has some responsive aspects to it, so if you're able, pull it up
            on another device and see what changes. The project showcase page
            especially gave me trouble, so please spend some time there and let
            me know what you think through the various links to contact me.
        </p>
